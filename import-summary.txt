ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* build.gradle
* gradle/
* gradle/wrapper/
* gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar
* gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties
* gradlew
* gradlew.bat
* ic_launcher-web.png
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* libs/armeabi/libzbar.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libzbar.so
* libs/commons-codec-1.4.jar => app/libs/commons-codec-1.4.jar
* libs/commons-fileupload-1.2.2.jar => app/libs/commons-fileupload-1.2.2.jar
* libs/commons-logging-1.1.1.jar => app/libs/commons-logging-1.1.1.jar
* libs/httpclient-4.1.3.jar => app/libs/httpclient-4.1.3.jar
* libs/httpclient-cache-4.1.3.jar => app/libs/httpclient-cache-4.1.3.jar
* libs/httpcore-4.1.4.jar => app/libs/httpcore-4.1.4.jar
* libs/httpmime-4.1.3.jar => app/libs/httpmime-4.1.3.jar
* lint.xml => app/lint.xml
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
